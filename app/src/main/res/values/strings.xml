    <string name="privacy_policy">My normal privacy policy explains tha I have no intention of harvesting or collecting your data but that I can\'t guarantee it\'s security. I think that this is still true with this app. I really like telegram and recommend it to everyone. But in my personal opinion you can\' rely on privacy when using a computer. If your worried about my app vs telegram itself then please feel free to browse github and search cagney moreau to view the code with a brief explanation of how it works. </string>
